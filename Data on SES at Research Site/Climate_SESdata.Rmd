## (1) Income Data

Household family income was assessed using 9 ranges:

  1. $25,000 or less
  2. $25,001-$40,000
  3. $40,001-$70,000
  4. $70,001-$90,000
  5. $90,001-$120,000
  6. $120,001-$150,000
  7. $150,001-$200,000
  8. $200,001-$300,000
  9. $300,001 or more

**Total *N* who completed this measure:** `r describe(Income)[2]`

**Median income:** `r describe(Income)[5]`

## (2) Subjective SES Data

Subjective SES was assessed using the MacArthur Scale of Subjective SES (i.e., the SES ladder), which was completed on paper, so some participants marked between the rungs (scored #.5).

**Total *N* who completed this measure:** `r describe(USldr)[2]`

**Median subjective SES:** `r describe(USldr)[5]`th rung
